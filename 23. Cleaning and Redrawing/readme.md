Tools used: **Adobe Photoshop** (Pen Tool, Clone Stamp, Healing Brush, Content Aware Fill, Brushes...)

### Main Painpoint

Speedlines redraw are really painful. Still learning a lot, improvising, this took me 5+ hr, yet cannot get the satisfactory result, need more advice and some genuine help on how pros do it.
