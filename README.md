# Visual Edits Portfolio

This repository is a showcase of my image editing work, focusing on **scanlation cleaning**, **redrawing**, and **general photo retouching**. All edits were done using **Adobe Photoshop**, with plans to explore **GIMP** and other open-source alternatives in the future.

Each folder contains a specific project with **before-and-after images**, so you can clearly see the transformation and the techniques used.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Adobe Photoshop 2019 and 2022 ( [Download here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17PheyyF9dm7YYjaTZ9JAAY3hhdeIQ7sJ4sylTG9_6xI/edit?tab=t.0) )
- (Planned for future) GIMP
- PIXIMPERFECT tutorials on tools have been livesaver.


## 📂 Folder Structure
Each folder contains:
- `before.png` — Original image
- `after.png` — Final result
- `README.md` — Side-by-side comparison and context
- the photoshop file used in `psd` format
