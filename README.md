# Visual Edits Portfolio

This repository is a showcase of my image editing work, focusing on **scanlation cleaning**, **redrawing**, and **general photo retouching**. All edits were done using **Adobe Photoshop**, with plans to explore **GIMP** and other open-source alternatives in the future.

Each folder contains a specific project with **before-and-after images**, so you can clearly see the transformation and the techniques used.
